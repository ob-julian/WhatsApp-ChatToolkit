I built this in a few hours to troll some friends because voice messages in a group I'm in were getting out of hand.

## Features

* Tracks the duration and count of voice messages in **one** WhatsApp chat or group.
* Sends reminders to users about their voice message usage.
* Easy setup and configuration.
* Uses lighthearted sarcasm.
* Respons messages are customizable via 2 config files.
* Responsive are at tthe moment only in German, but you can easily replace them with your own.

## Installation

1. Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already:

   * [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   * Personal recommendation: use a Node Version Manager (e.g., NVM).
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ob-julian/WhatsApp-SprachnachrichtCounter
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:

4. Install the dependencies:

6. Oftentimes, you need to download specific libraries if your system does not have Chromium installed. And even then, you might need to install a few more libraries. If you run into issues, please refer to the [Puppeteer troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md)


## Extending the Script

This project is designed to be easily extendable. 

### Commands

To add a new command, simply create a new file in the `commands` directory. Each command file should export an object with the following properties:

```javascript
{
  name: 'commandName', // The command's trigger word (e.g., 'status')
  description: 'Description of the command', // A short explanation of what the command does
  restrictions: {
      self: true,        // If true, only messages sent by yourself (the bot account) can trigger this command
      group: true,       // If true, the command can be used in group chats
      private: true,     // If true, the command can be used in private (1:1) chats
      selfMessage: true  // If true, the command can be used in your own self-chat (messaging yourself). This is useful for sensitive commands, assuming the bot runs on your personal account.
  },
  execute: (client, message, config, args) => {
    // Your command logic here
  }
}
```

### client.on interaction

To add a new interaction handler, create a new file in the `client_on` directory. Each file should export a object with the following properties:

```javascript
{
  event: 'message_create', // The event to listen for (e.g., 'message_create', 'ready' ...)
  handler: (client, message, config) => {
    // Your interaction logic here
  }
}
```
